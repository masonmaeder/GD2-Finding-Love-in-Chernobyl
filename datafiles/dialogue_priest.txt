TEXT: You trudge through a cold night, disoriented by radioactive fog and ruins. Fading fast, you glimpse a distant bonfire—a fragile beacon of hope against the dark. The camp shelters survivors huddled around the fire. Among them, one figure draws your attention: a priest in a tattered black robe. You notice a serene smile coming from his pale face. “Hey, you seem lost.” He takes his robe off and rests it on you. At that moment, your heart swells with mixed emotions, and you are faced with a choice:

I am guided by God to spread hope among the survivors.”

TEXT: With a trembling voice, you ask, “Where is this place? Why did I come here?” His eyes fill with sorrow. He replies, “This is Pripyat—once a thriving city, now destroyed. Perhaps fate brought you here.” He draws you to sit by the bonfire, the fire warming your hands and faces. “I want to explore, to see if I can find more information about this place,” you say. The priest frowns, concern flashing in his eyes, “This place is very dangerous; radiation is everywhere. It would be too dangerous to venture out on your own.” You insist, sounding more determined, “I should try at least!” He sighs, “Fine, but promise me you will be careful.” You nod, your heart filled with gratitude knowing at least one person as your back.

Perhaps it's the fact that you both know you'll die soon causing you both to well acquainted. One evening dinner time arrives and everyone gathers around the bonfire. Sharing the few rations available, you eat slowly. You sit next to the priest, and he offers you a piece of bread from his own share.

#ID: dealer_call_out
TEXT: "So you found where I'm staying hmm?" The voice turns on the flickering light. It's a younger man sitting on an old mattress. You've heard about the arms dealer, but you didn't think he was so friendly with the priest. "It's great to see you again priest." "Jesus, Mary, and Joseph," the priest punches the man in the shoulder, "almost scared me to heavens." "Sorry I missed the last few sermons." The dealer replies. The two fall into deep conversation. You learn that some believe he holds secrets that might be the key either to the city’s resurgence or to helping survivors find their way back home. Noticing your gaze, the arms dealer slowly approaches you. “How the hell did you two survive out there like this?” "We were staying near the tents. I'd like to think it was the campfire." "Yeah... sure." The dealer mocks. “Look, I want you to do something for me." He locks eyes with the priest. "Yes?" The priest responds. "Deep within that radiation zone lies the key that can truly change everything. We've tried to look through it a few times, some of us didn't make it back.” He starts to cough. "I don't think I have much time left." The priest sits down next to the dealer, patting his back. "Are you sure there's something worthy there?" "I'm not sure, but there's nothing out here for us." He coughs again, this time blood. "Why not risk it if we're all going to end up 6ft under anyway?" At this moment, you're faced with a choice:
CHOICE: Decide to venture the radiation zone|radiation_adventure

You let the arms dealer know that you both will not be going, then return to camp. Although disappointed, the arms dealer understands. After a few days, a pit of guilt and curiosity builds in your gut. You can't help but feel that you both should explore the radiation zone. "Maybe we should go?" You ask the priest. "Maybe there's something there?" "What's with the change in heart now? We told the dealer otherwise." He responds. "I'm not sure.. it's as if somethings calling me to it." "Just like how I got my calling here hm?" You nod. "Okay. We'll head over to the dealer in the morning."

#ID: radiation_adventure_start
TEXT: With determined eyes, you and the priest decide to step in together. You both move side by side, confronting the acrid stench and the swirling dust laden with radiation. The wind seems to be heavier this time around though. The fog is as thick as you remember from the first time. The priest shields you from the wind with his body. Looking up at his gentle face, you joke with him. "So, you're not scared of this... but you're scared of the dark." "I have my reasons" he states. "Who'd want to look at this beautiful face in the dark?" You laugh, staring into his eyes through the gas mask, "Not me." "So, where should we go? Towards the smoke or the trees over there?"
CHOICE: Go towards the smoke.|smoke_stacks_area
CHOICE: Go towards the trees.|trees_forest_area 

#ID: smoke_stacks_area
You both trek towards the smoke, only to discover some smoke stacks. This was likely one of the exit points where the blast escaped from. The smoke stacks seem to be in-tact however. During your arduous journey, you discover a pitiful vagrant. Its clothes are torn and its skin has become leather-like. It lies weakly curled up in a corner, eyes filled terror and tears.
CHOICE: Help the vagrant, lift them up and offer food and water|rad_zone_kind
CHOICE: Search nearby for medical supplies and then return to assist the vagrant|rad_zone_kind

CHOICE: Hesitantly decide to heartlessly leave them behind|rad_zone_cautious 

#ID: rad_zone_kind
TEXT: You step forward without hesitation. You retrieve the little food you have from your backpack and carefully offer it to the vagrant. Their trembling, emaciated hand reaches out and devours the food. The priest stands nearby, silently approving of your kindness. A hint of life seems to return to the vagrant. The vagrant nods. It seems like they can't make much facial expression due to their injuries. The priest asks the vagrant, "You came here with the arms dealer, right?" The vagrant nods once more, attempting to form a smile. "I will try to let him know, he's not in the best condition" the priest remarks. Before parting ways, the vagrant hands you an old, yet intact compass. "Why don't you come along with us?" You ask. The vagrant shakes their head. "They're likely safer here then out there. They've probably built the resistance to be in here without masks." "Thank you so much. We will return when we can." The vagrant appears to be smiling.
CHOICE: Head over to the trees you both saw earlier|trees_forest_area
CHOICE: Return to camp to resupply and replan your journey|rad_zone_replan 

#ID: rad_zone_replan

CHOICE: Set off immediately on your renewed journey|trees_forest_area 

#ID: rad_zone_cautious
TEXT: Unable to bear the sight of the vagrant’s suffering, a conflict of sympathy and self-preservation overwhelms you. In the end, fear wins over compassion, and you decide to leave him behind. The priest, though his expression reveals mixed emotions, says little as he follows you. Back at the camp, the priest’s attitude toward you changes completely. He begins to do tasks alone and avoids any contact with you. You try to explain yourself, but his response is cold. Although together physically, the bond has vanished. Overwhelmed by loneliness and regret, you silently vow to grow stronger, even as your relationship with the priest slowly disintegrates.
CHOICE: Leave|leave 

#ID: trees_forest_area
TEXT: You both walk the opposite direction from before, following one another closely per usual. "I've heard about the reclaimed forest area, but I didn't think it was real" he recounts. "The dealer told me all about it during his first expedition. I wish I came along." Nearing the forest, you take note of the gorgeous yet haunting zone. It's as if it were a forgotten world. Mutated plants with thick branches full of warts, sharp leaves seemingly resembling blades, emitting a sound unparallel to anything. A thin mist shrouds the area, the zone is oddly humid. In the heart of the forest clearing is a lake. The water appears clean and bright, the sun shining on the ripples despite there being no sun around when you both walked in initially. As you walk through the forest, you both encounter a small group of survivors. Their clothes are tattered, legs are patched-up, and eyes are filled with dread.
CHOICE: Talk to them|survivor_conversation
CHOICE: Remain cautious, fearing that resources might be stolen, and refuse to communicate|forest_cautious  

#ID: survivor_conversation
TEXT: "You must've came with the dealer I presume." The priest initiates. "Yes, our group split up and the second half went to the smoke stacks." One of the survivors responds. "Do you seem to have anything we could use?" The other survivors look at you both with wide eyes.
CHOICE: Share supplies and seek deeper cooperation|forest_friendly
CHOICE: Inquire about why and how they're here|forest_friendly
CHOICE: They are not one of us, hardly trustworthy—plan to leave immediately|forest_cautious 

#ID: forest_friendly
TEXT: You quickly open your backpack and distribute the goods, winning the survivors’ trust and gratitude. An elderly survivor, visibly moved, says, “It’s been a long time since we’ve seen someone so kind.” The tense atmosphere eases, and soon everyone begins to engage in warm conversation with you. Your curiosity about Pripyat’s secrets grows. Through in-depth dialogue with the survivors, you come to realize that they might hold the key clues to unraveling the mysteries of the radiation zone. You ask them, “Could you tell us more about what happened in Pripyat? We are desperate to understand how all of this unfolded.” The survivors lead you to an area in the forest which they claim is safer. They recount tales of a green-haired girl in the forest and the crazy experiments in Pripyat. As you listen, you frequently exchange glances with the priest, sharing thoughts and doubts. When a survivor hints that the experiments might be linked to the radiation outbreak, both you and the priest are taken aback.
CHOICE: Without hesitation, return to the camp immediately|adventure_done 

#ID: forest_cautious
TEXT: Gazing at the group of survivors who have suddenly appeared like ghosts, a warning bell rings in your head. In this game of survival, you know that one extra person means additional wasted resources. You decide without hesitation to refuse. The priest’s eyes brim with bewilderment; he tries to seize your arm and gently suggests, “let’s hear them out?” But you remain resolute, holding onto the priest’s arm tightly and dragging him away. Back at the camp, the priest’s attitude toward you changes completely. He begins to do tasks alone and avoids any contact with you. You try to explain yourself, but his response is cold. Although together physically, the bond has vanished. Overwhelmed by loneliness and regret, you silently vow to grow stronger, even as your relationship with the priest slowly disintegrates.
CHOICE: Leave|leave 

#ID: adventure_done
TEXT: Although dreadfully exhausted, you both feel a sense of trust and comradery in one another. You rest in the makeshift bed and he sits beside you. "Thank you for coming with me to the radiation zone today." He coughs. "I've only been twice, and the second time was to save you." "Yeah.. I felt like I needed to go." You say, starting to fall asleep. He kisses your forehead. "I was able to see some old faces, it felt good to reconnect even though I know I'll never see them for a while." You drift off into a deep sleep, content and happy knowing that the priest is by your side.
