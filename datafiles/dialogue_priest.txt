TEXT: Chapter 1: A Cold Night’s First Encounter
You—a wanderer who has lost your memory—struggle through a frozen, snowy night. Hunger, cold, and confusion shadow your every step; your legs feel as if they are filled with lead. The radioactive snow and fog blur your vision, leaving you disoriented amid the ruins, as your consciousness gradually fades. Just as the flame of life seems about to be snuffed out, you notice a barely visible bonfire in the camp—a beacon of hope flickering in the darkness.
The camp sits at the edge of the main area, with a few worn-out tents swaying in the howling wind around the crackling bonfire. This fire is the camp’s only source of warmth and light; sparks fly in defiance, as if fighting against the dark. Around the bonfire, weathered survivors sit together, their eyes shining with a desperate longing for life. This temporary shelter, laden with hope and helplessness, serves as a place for fellowship and mutual aid.
As you approach the bonfire, one figure captures your attention—the priest. Clad in a shabby black robe that flutters in the wind, he wears a stained white shawl that nevertheless appears refined; the golden cross on it glimmers mysteriously in the firelight. The priest is tall and slender, his angular, gaunt face marked by distinct features. His brown hair is slightly disheveled, with strands dancing in the breeze. Beneath a prominent nose, his thin lips curve into a gentle, enigmatic smile, and his dee...
Breaking the silence first, the priest speaks in a low, warm voice that carries clearly over the wind:
“Traveler from afar, you seem lost.”
At that moment, your heart swells with mixed emotions, and you are faced with a choice:
CHOICE: Step forward slowly and honestly confess your memory loss|honest
CHOICE: Stand still, remaining silent|honest
CHOICE: Look around in confusion and ask why you have come here|curious
CHOICE: Approach actively and gesture with your hands to inquire about the surroundings|curious

TEXT: Your voice trembles as you say, “I’ve lost my memory—I don’t know who I am.” With those words, a wave of loneliness crashes over you; you lower your gaze, unable to meet the priest’s eyes.
He steps closer and gently brushes the snow from your shoulder. In a low, warm tone he comforts you:
“Losing your memory is painful, but here, you can rediscover yourself. I am guided by God to spread hope.”
Reaching into his coat, he produces an old radio, and as music begins to flow out, it seems to chase away the fear within you. Smiling, he adds, “Music soothes the soul, and faith can light up the darkness.”
Amid the gentle strains of music, he tells you stories of faith and shares his hopeful vision for the future, his voice resolute and warm. You feel the chill of loneliness replaced by warmth, and in the light of his eyes, you see hope shining through.
“From today, I will help you get acquainted with life in the camp,” he says as he guides you around, introducing you to the other survivors. Though life is hard, their faces are softened by hopeful smiles. The priest assures you, “We will work together to rebuild our home. You are not alone—we are all here.”
Under his care, you gradually become familiar with camp life. Every morning, you join him in prayer at the chapel, feeling the power of faith. In the evening, you gather around the bonfire to listen to classical music and share your stories. Slowly, your heart fills with warmth and strength, and the loneliness begins to fade. An unspoken bond forms between you—one that you come to rely on, and he, in turn, is ever ready to support you. In this desolation, you find each other, and together you find hope.
One day, the priest looks at you intently and says, “We need to secure more supplies for the camp. Will you join me tomorrow in exploring the main residential area?”
CHOICE: With resolute eyes, “I am willing. I want to contribute to the camp.”|camp_life

#ID: curious
TEXT: With a trembling and fearful voice, you ask, “Where is this place? Why did I come here?” His eyes fill with sorrow, as if the ruins themselves are reflected in them, and he replies, “This is Pripyat—once a thriving city, now shrouded in disaster. Perhaps fate has brought you here.”
He draws you to sit by the bonfire, the warm light illuminating your faces, and begins a slow, poignant account of the city’s history.
In his deep, magnetic voice, the priest describes Pripyat’s calamity—from its once-towering buildings and bustling streets to the present state of ruins and silence. Every detail leaves you stunned. Overwhelmed by curiosity, a strong urge surges within you to understand all that has happened and to discern your own connection to this land. “I want to explore, to see if I can find more information about this place,” you exclaim eagerly.
The priest frowns, concern flashing in his eyes, “This place is very dangerous; radiation and unknown threats lurk everywhere. You have just arrived and are unfamiliar with the dangers—it would be too reckless to venture out on your own.”
Yet driven by curiosity, you insist, “I know the risks, but I must try. I feel a connection between me and this place—perhaps it holds clues about who I am.”
Rising to your feet with determination in your eyes, you prepare to set off. He sighs with resignation and care, “Very well, but promise me you will be careful. I will wait in the camp; if you encounter danger, return immediately.”
You nod, your heart filled with gratitude, and set off alone into the radiation zone, with hope and apprehension mingling within you.
It isn’t long before you realize that the priest’s concerns were not unfounded. The radiation zone is harsher than you imagined—with fissured ground and an air reeking with acrid fumes. Despite your caution, you inadvertently trigger a hidden trap. A sudden force strikes you, and you collapse to the ground.
You struggle to rise, but your strength fades. Overwhelmed by peril, regret and fear grip you. You try to call out the priest’s name, but your voice is swallowed by the roaring wind.
Just as you are about to give up, the priest’s figure appears suddenly. Seeing you injured, his eyes reveal a mix of resignation and concern, “You were too impulsive, not listening to my warning.”
Quickly, he helps you return to the camp.
Your leg is injured so severely that you can barely walk. With skilled and gentle care, the priest tends to your wound. As you lie on a makeshift bed watching him, a deep guilt overwhelms you: “I’m sorry—I was too impulsive.”

After you and the priest gradually become familiar with daily life at the camp, one evening dinner time arrives. Everyone gathers around the bonfire, sharing the few rations available. You sit next to the priest, and he offers you a relatively fine piece of bread from his own share. You now face a choice:
CHOICE: Cheerfully accept with gratitude|camp_mutual_aid
CHOICE: Politely decline with a hint of reservation|camp_personal_choice

#ID: camp_mutual_aid
TEXT: “Eat more—you’ve been working so hard these past few days and have lost weight,” he says, watching you with concern. Warmth fills your heart as you take the bread and reply, “Don’t just worry about me; you need to eat enough too, so you have the strength.” You break the bread in half and hand one half back to him. In this simple act of sharing food, you exchange smiles, and those around you watch with envy. In that moment, your bond deepens through these small, everyday acts.
Later during an exploration, you accidentally wander near the edge of the radiation zone. Suddenly, you feel a sharp, stinging pain throughout your body, followed by nausea and dizziness. Realizing you’ve developed mild radiation sickness, you urgently call for his help. The priest quickly rushes you back to the camp, where he uses his limited medical skills to treat your wounds and gives you a homemade anti-radiation remedy. His eyes, full of concern, bring a long-forgotten warmth to your heart.

TEXT: When the priest offers you the bread, you feel a momentary hesitation. Not used to such intimate gestures—in this desolate place where everyone is preoccupied with their own survival—you force a small smile and politely reply, “No, thank you. You eat it yourself—I’m not really hungry.” You turn your head away, unwilling to meet his eyes, trying to hide the turmoil inside. The priest appears somewhat surprised; his hand lingers in mid-air for a moment before he silently takes back the bread.
Later, during an exploration, you find yourself near the edge of the radiation zone and quickly develop mild radiation sickness. Your body is overwhelmed by sharp pains, nausea, and dizziness that leave you barely able to stand. Though you had hesitated earlier by refusing the priest’s bread, your worsening condition compels you to call for help.
Upon hearing your plea, the priest immediately drops what he’s doing and rushes over. Seeing your pale face, his eyes fill with urgency as he swiftly carries you back to the camp, gently comforting you along the way. Back at the camp, he places you on a makeshift bed and quickly administers his homemade anti-radiation remedy, soothing your fears with his gentle reassurances. Watching him work with such tender dedication, you feel a surge of gratitude and guilt, longing to apologize. But the priest smiles and interrupts, urging you simply to rest. His warm, compassionate gaze makes you realize that your bond has grown even stronger through this ordeal.

TEXT: Chapter 3: Rumors of the Mysterious Arms Dealer
In the desolate land of Pripyat, the corners of the camp ruins are often where mysterious energies converge. Recently, whispers of a mysterious arms dealer have quietly spread among the camp residents, sparking their curiosity.
This arms dealer appears unexpectedly, always clad in a tattered gray coat with his hood and mask concealing his face, revealing only a pair of piercing eyes. He carries various weapons and rare supplies, drawing a crowd whose eyes gleam with longing and awe.
You and the priest are drawn to this corner, observing the arms dealer and listening to the murmurs of others. You learn that some believe he holds the secrets of Pripyat—secrets that might be the key either to the city’s resurgence or to helping survivors find better ways to live.
Noticing your gaze, the arms dealer slowly approaches you, his steps measured and assured. He scrutinizes you both before speaking in a hoarse, penetrating voice:
“Come now, you two—you don’t seem content merely to scrape by here at the camp.”
His eyes shift toward the radiation zone as he continues, “Deep within that dangerous area lies the key that can truly change everything.” He finishes with a mysterious smile as if hinting at hidden truths.
At this moment, you face a choice:

TEXT: With determined eyes, you and the priest decide to step into the dangerous radiation zone together, intent on uncovering its secrets. The arms dealer hands you protective gear and warns you to be cautious. Once you have donned the gear, you both move into the radiation zone side by side, confronting the acrid stench and the swirling dust laden with radiation.
On a cracked asphalt road, sporadically lit by flaming barrels, you huddle together in a low-lying area where the radiation dust gathers and the wind howls relentlessly. The priest shields you from the biting sand and wind with his body. Looking up at his gentle face, you whisper with deep affection,
“I have never regretted walking into this dangerous place with you.”
The priest tenderly strokes your cheek and smiles, “Ever since our first meeting by the campfire, I knew you would be someone extraordinary in my life. With you by my side on this journey, I am truly happy.”
Your eyes well up with tears that quickly dry in the dusty wind, and you murmur, “Without you, I would have fallen long ago. Each time I felt I couldn’t go on, your unwavering gaze gave me the strength to continue.”
He embraces you tightly and gently kisses your forehead, “You have given me a reason to love this broken world again. Your bravery and kindness make me believe that even in the darkest times, beauty can be found.”
As the wind subsides and silence falls over the desolation—almost as if the wasteland itself is mourning—the two of you share a quiet moment. Leaning into his embrace, you softly say, “At least we’re not alone. Walking this path together, I have no regrets.”
He nods, resting his chin on your head, “We will face it all together. One day, in another life, we’ll find a place free from radiation and disaster.”

TEXT: After hearing the arms dealer describe the perils of the radiation zone, you decide not to risk adventure for now. You make your sentiments known to both the arms dealer and the priest, then return to camp. Once back, you settle into a stable life in the camp—helping repair equipment and sharing the few available supplies with the other survivors.
Still, your curiosity about the radiation zone’s secrets lingers. You begin to pay closer attention to related rumors, eager to gather information from the experiences of others. You learn that a group of survivors once ventured to the very edge of the radiation zone and returned with strange trinkets. You approach them, piecing together details about the hazards and safety measures necessary within the zone.
With the skills and knowledge you accumulate, you help resolve many problems at camp, gradually becoming indispensable. The information you collect provides essential guidance for formulating strategies, and your cautious choices allow you to contribute to camp life safely.
Through your efforts, you begin to understand the importance of teamwork and careful information gathering. Along the way, you and the priest spend many evenings discussing future plans for stabilizing the camp, and the mutual understanding between you deepens.
At this juncture, a new choice presents itself:

#ID: radiation_delay
TEXT: On the eve of your planned venture into the radiation zone, a fierce storm suddenly descends upon the camp. With roaring winds and torrential rain, numerous facilities are overturned, and tents sway precariously under the onslaught. Everyone rushes into an intense rescue effort.
Drawing on your rich experience, you lead the charge to reinforce the tents and clear drainage channels, desperately trying to keep the camp from being flooded. In the midst of this emergency, you find you simply cannot leave for the radiation zone, and your planned expedition must be postponed.
After several days and nights of tireless work, order is gradually restored in the camp.
However, just then, the patrol team discovers strange tracks in the surrounding area—signs that mutated creatures, likely affected by radiation, are slowly closing in on the camp.
This news casts a renewed pall of tension over everyone, and it becomes clear that unless the secrets of the radiation zone are uncovered and countermeasures established, the camp could face a dire threat.
After weighing your options, you and the priest decide to resume your plan to venture into the radiation zone—this time, out of necessity for the camp’s safety, you must act immediately.

TEXT: Chapter 4: The Adventure in the Radiation Zone
With equal parts apprehension and resolve, you and the priest step into the daunting radiation zone. Immediately upon entry, a nauseating smell assaults your senses—a rancid mix of burnt metal, rotting stench, and the eerie tang of radiation that makes you retch. The ground is lined with trails of glowing slime that wriggle as if alive, leaving behind spine chilling traces. The slime displays bizarre hues: some are a blue‐green reminiscent of otherworldly substances, others a deep red like congealed blood. Along the cracked asphalt, strange cyan flames burst forth intermittently, dancing in a twisted, wavering manner with an unusual heat.
In the distance, a silent chimney sometimes emits pale gray smoke that twists and disperses, as if telling tales of past disasters. Its surface is scarred by time and radiation erosion—bricks flake off and the structure appears ready to collapse.
During your arduous journey, you discover a pitiful vagrant. His clothes are tattered, stained, and riddled with holes; marks of radiation burns mar his skin. His body bears mottled scars from prolonged exposure—some areas have even begun to ulcerate, exuding a foul odor. The ulcerated patches are a purple red, surrounded by rough, cracked skin resembling scorched leather. He lies weakly curled up in a corner, his eyes filled with terror and despair.

#ID: rad_zone_kind
TEXT: Moved by compassion, you step forward without hesitation. You retrieve the little food you have from your backpack and carefully offer it to the vagrant. In an instant, a spark of light shines in his cloudy eyes. His trembling, emaciated hand reaches out and he grasps the food, devouring it hungrily—even as his cracked lips are cut, bleeding in thin trickles, he seems oblivious to the pain. The priest stands nearby, silently approving of your kindness.
Under your care, the vagrant’s color gradually improves and a hint of life returns to his gaze. Just as he seems about to speak his gratitude, a low, rumbling roar echoes through the area. A pack of mutated beasts, their skin grotesquely twisted and reeking with decay, with eyes that glimmer with a bloody ferocity and jaws baring sharp fangs, suddenly surge toward you.
You and the priest quickly take defensive positions, backs against each other. You brandish an iron club while the priest lunges with his dagger. The battle is fierce—you sustain cuts on your arm but press on despite the pain. The vagrant, too, joins the fray in a desperate bid to divert the beasts’ attention.
After a grueling fight, the beasts are repelled. Exhausted, you and the priest sit on the ground, bodies marked with wounds. Amid the ruins, you discover an old, battered chest guarded by the retreating creatures. Inside, you find precious supplies: medical items along with uncontaminated food and water.
The vagrant then leads you along a hidden pathway, carefully avoiding further hazards and dangerous mutants. As he recounts his own experiences in the radiation zone and hints at secret passageways, you marvel at his intimate familiarity with this toxic land. He recalls a time when, after suffering severe radiation burns, he was saved by something resembling a blob of living slime. You and the priest share a smile, a warmth rising within you both that brings you closer together.
Before parting ways, the vagrant hands you an old, yet intact compass and wishes you good fortune.

You gather more food and water, meticulously inspect and repair your weapons and gear, and consult with experienced comrades about the best strategies for facing the dangers of the radiation zone. With everything in order and your resolve renewed, you set off once more toward the mysterious forest clearing.

TEXT: Unable to bear the sight of the vagrant’s suffering, a conflict of sympathy and self-preservation overwhelms you. In the end, fear wins over compassion, and you decide to leave him behind. The priest, though his expression reveals mixed emotions, says little as he follows you.
As you proceed, the environment worsens—the radiation intensifies, the ground buckles with cracks and collapses, and the intertwining paths of slime and flickering flame form nearly impassable barriers. Lost among these obstacles, you inadvertently wander into the very heart of the radiation zone. Your protective gear fails, and your body begins a severe reaction. After a strenuous struggle, you manage to escape the core zone, but at a tremendous cost: your body grows weak, your equipment is badly damaged, and you suffer significant radiation injuries.
Back at the camp, the priest’s attitude toward you changes completely. No longer does he trust or support you; his eyes now brim with disappointment and distancing, and he begins to undertake tasks alone to avoid any contact with you. You try to explain yourself, but his response is cold—his once-warm voice reduced to indifferent tones. Although you remain together physically, the bond you once shared has all but vanished. Overwhelmed by loneliness and regret, you silently vow to grow stronger, hoping someday to atone for your mistakes, even as your relationship with the priest slowly disintegrates.

TEXT: Chapter 5: The Secret of the Mysterious Forest Clearing
The mysterious forest clearing is located on the edge of the radiation zone, as if it were a forgotten world. Mutated plants tower in twisted, contorted shapes, their thick branches covered in wart-like protrusions that glimmer with fluorescence; their leaves are narrow and sharp like blades scraping in the wind, emitting a rustling sound. Dappled shadows dance on the ground, and a thin mist shrouds the area, adding an air of unknown dread.
You and the priest explore the radiation zone at the forest’s edge, your nerves on edge as the bizarre surroundings heighten your alertness. Curiosity compels you to venture deeper into the forest. In the heart of the forest clearing, under the moonlight, an ancient altar appears—its surface inscribed with mysterious symbols and exuding an aura of antiquity. As you study the altar, a group of survivors emerges; they are clad in tattered clothes, armed, with patched-up legs, their eyes cautious yet filled with a longing for kinship. Through conversation, you learn about the disastrous history of Pripyat, intricately linked to the current state of the radiation zone.

TEXT: You quickly open your backpack and display the precious supplies that you and the priest have painstakingly accumulated—food and medical items—to the survivors. In the radiation zone, such supplies are exceedingly valuable. With firm yet gentle care, you distribute the goods, winning the survivors’ trust and gratitude. An elderly survivor, visibly moved, says, “It’s been a long time since we’ve seen someone so kind.” The atmosphere eases, and soon everyone begins to engage in warm conversation with you.
Your curiosity about Pripyat’s secrets grows. Through in-depth dialogue with the survivors, you come to realize that they might hold the key clues to unraveling the mysteries of the radiation zone. Humbly and sincerely, you ask them, “Could you tell us more about what happened in Pripyat? We are desperate to understand how all of this unfolded.” Touched by your sincere demeanor, the survivors begin recounting tales of a green-haired girl in the forest and the enigmatic experiments in Pripyat.
As you listen, you frequently exchange glances with the priest, sharing thoughts and doubts. When a survivor hints that the experiments might be linked to the radiation outbreak, both you and the priest are taken aback; the priest nods in agreement, suggesting that even deeper secrets might lie behind it all. Together, you analyze the information, striving to piece together the truth and uncover clues to improve the situation. In doing so, you discover that your ways of thinking and values resonate profoundly with one another—the shared pursuit of truth and survival binding your hearts tightly.

You secure these items tightly to your body, ensuring they won’t fall off in the rush.
“Come on, time waits for no one!” your companion urges with a note of anxiety. You nod, take a deep breath, fasten your backpack, and sprint toward the camp alongside him. Though your heart is filled with worry, you know that only by being well-prepared can you protect yourself and others in a crisis.

TEXT: Gazing at the group of survivors who have suddenly appeared like phantoms, a warning bell rings in your heart—caution surges like an overwhelming tide. In this barren, radiation-soaked wasteland where every single supply is a beacon of hope for you and the priest’s survival, you know that one extra person means additional consumption—especially when they are strangers. Thus, when the survivors, with seemingly friendly smiles, signal their desire to communicate, you decide without hesitation to refuse.
The priest’s eyes brim with bewilderment; he tries to seize your arm and gently suggests, “Maybe they could offer us some useful information—let’s hear them out?” But you remain resolute, forcefully shaking off his hand and retorting, “People who appear out of nowhere are too bizarre—no nonsense, let’s go!” With that, you grip the priest’s arm tightly and drag him away. Although he staggers behind, continuously trying to persuade you to reconsider, your ears seem plugged, and his words fail to reach you.
After leaving, you continue exploring the edge of the radiation zone but fail to uncover any more valuable information. The priest, while not overtly blaming you, shows disappointment in his eyes. The disagreement creates a rift between you—once-unbreakable trust and rapport now show signs of strain. In your struggle for survival, each attempt to make amends with the priest only reveals a growing distance between you; the once-strong bond gradually deteriorates. The priest begins to doubt your judgment, and you are filled with regret over your stubbornness. The steadfast camaraderie that once saw you through hardships slowly fades, leaving you as the most familiar strangers to one another, each burdened with complex emotions, wandering alone in a harsh world.
